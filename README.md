# ENTANGLE
A lightweight ESP32 library for real-time hardware mirroring via ESP-NOW. It creates a low-latency "virtual wire" between two nodes, automatically syncing GPIO states and PWM values through a distributed bitmask. No network stack required—just seamless, symmetric state synchronization for instant peer-to-peer hardware entanglement
